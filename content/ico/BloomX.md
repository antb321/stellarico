long_description: "<p>
<li>BloomX is connecting neighborhood moneychangers across Asia to the Stellar decentralized exchange, and teaching people to use cryptocurrencies safely.</li>
<li>Our Teller app will be used by moneychangers and remittance agents to buy/sell crypto over the counter, and our Wallet app will be used by end-customers to store their crypto and access other BloomX services.</li>
<li>The BX8 token will be used to pay for each business transaction on the network, and additionally acts as cashback for the end-customers. We've signed up three big institutional partners in the Philippines to pilot the platform as early as Q3 2018, and aim to expand to neighboring countries by 2019.</li></p>

<p>
<h2>About BloomX</h2>
<li>The BloomX app store is an initiative developed by Bloom Technologies Pte. Ltd., a crypto-remittance pioneer with operations in:
<ul>
 <li>Singapore</li>
 <li>the Philippines</li>
 <li>Australia</li>
</ul>
<li>The app store is intended for licensed Money Services Businesses (MSBs) around the world to create new service offerings or upgrade existing services with turn-key cryptocurrency solutions.</li>
<li>These MSBs include money transfer operators, foreign currency exchange companies, and other non-bank financial institutions.</li>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Primary Launch Applications on BloomX</h2>

The primary launch applications on BloomX will include the following:

<li>Crypto Foreign Exchange (CFX).</li>
<li>The CFX app will allow forex agents and their individual outlets to buy and sell major cryptocurrencies over the counter.</li>
<li>CFX will provide an easy and secure interface into the Stellar decentralized exchange as the primary source of liquidity</li></p>
<p>
<li>Multi-Cryptocurrency Wallet (MCW) The MCW app will give end-users safe and guided access to their cryptocurrency holdings and is expected to be branded by the respective MSB.</li>
<li>The wallet app will employ a hybrid security model, wherein each new customer will receive a custodial wallet initially.<li>
<li>Over time, the customer will be encouraged to move their cryptocurrency funds out of the custodial wallet and into a more decentralized, non-custodial environment.<li>
<p>
  <li>Remittance Agent Dashboard (RAD) app The RAD app will allow money transfer operators to facilitate cryptocurrency-powered remittances to and from any supported country within the BloomX network.</li> <li>Currently, these countries include:
  <ul>
   <li>South Korea</li>
   <li>Singapore</li>
   <li>Hong Kong</li>
   <li>Australia</li>
   <li>Vietnam<li>
   <li>Indonesia</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The RAD app has been commercially available since Q1 2016 and has facilitated over $125 ,000,000 in customer transactions.</li>
</p>
<p>
The BloomX platform will launch with these three apps in Q4 2018. In Q3 2019, the BloomX app store will be opened to third-party developers who wish to create additional apps and services for MSBs, fostering a marketplace for enhanced financial services and compliant tools.
</p>

<p>
 <li>All commercial transactions on the three flagship apps, and on the app store, will be paid for with BX8, which is a new token issued by Bloom Technologies specifically for use within the BloomX ecosystem.</li>
 <li>The token will be issued on the Stellar blockchain</li>
