<p>
	SureRemit connects immigrants abroad directly with merchants that provide the services needed by their loved ones back home. With Remit tokens, immigrants all over the world can access digital shopping vouchers that can be spent by loved ones on goods and services at accepting merchants wherever they are. They can also pay for hundreds of utility bills and mobile airtime credits directly from the SureRemit application.
</p>
<br>
<b><h3>About SureRemit<h3></b>
<br>
<p>
	The SureRemit token (RMT) is an utility token built on the Stellar Network, designed to be used by immigrants and customers within the SureRemit platform. Following this standard, SureRemit tokens are easily transferable between users and can be supported by wallets and exchanges that already support Stellar lumens.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	Within the SureRemit ecosystem, the Remit token (RMT) will be used internally to access vouchers and pay bills for targeted remittances. Immigrants and customers in general will be able to select the country they want to send value, search for the right merchant in a category and create an order for a voucher to be delivered to the recipient via SMS or Email, and pay in RMT token. Once the order is received, the token will be frozen until the voucher is sent from the SureRemit system. When that happens, the token is transferred to SureRemit. In the future, we hope to activate the direct acceptance of RMT tokens by the ecosystem partners, which they can in turn convert to Fiat, this will make token transfer happen directly to merchantâ€™s balance.
