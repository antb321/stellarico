<p>
The Bitbond Token (BB1) is Germany's first security token and aims to make business lending globally accessible. Bitbond is the first crypto-currency based lending platform for business loans that operates globally. Founded in 2013, Bitbond now facilitates more than $1 million in business loans every month. The issuer of the token is Bitbond Finance GmbH, a company fully owned by Bitbond GmbH. Token holders will receive 1% interest on their invested amount every quarter (4% per year). Additionally, token holders receive a variable coupon paid out once per year. Both the quarterly and the annual coupons continue for 10 years, at which point the token reaches its maturity and is bought back at its face value of €1 per token. If you want to take advantage of the discounts, we encourage you to invest on March 11th, 2019 as discounts will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.
